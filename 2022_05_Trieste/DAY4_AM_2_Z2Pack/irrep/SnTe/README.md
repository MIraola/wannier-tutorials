## Content

- `DFT`: contains the input needed to run the DFT calculations. The output of these calculations is analyzed later with `Z2Pack` and `IrRep` packages.
- `Z2Pack`: inputs and output of `Z2Pack` calculations and scrips to run them. 
- `IrRep`: inputs and output of `IrRep` calculations and scrips to run them.
